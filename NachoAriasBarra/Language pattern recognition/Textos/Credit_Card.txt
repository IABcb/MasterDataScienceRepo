Credit card firm Mastercard has confirmed it will accept selfie photos and fingerprints as an alternative to passwords when verifying IDs for online payments.
It follows a trial of the software carried out in the US and Netherlands last year.
The company told the BBC that 92% of its test subjects preferred the new system to passwords.
One expert said that such biometric checks had the potential to cut fraud.
