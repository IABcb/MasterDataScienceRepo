Roy Thomas Baker is an English record producer who helped create a number of extremely popular pop and rock records in the 1970s and 1980s. Perhaps best known for co-producing the enduring hit song "Bohemian Rhapsody" for Queen, he also worked with numerous, notable artists, including Guns N' Roses, The Who, The Rolling Stones, David Bowie, The Cars, Foreigner, Journey, Ozzy Osbourne, T. Rex, Devo, The Stranglers, Dusty Springfield, T'Pau, Starcastle, Yes, Cheap Trick, Gasolin' and The Darkness. Most recently he has worked with The Smashing Pumpkins.
Although he now spends much of his time at his studio in Arizona, Baker got his start at Decca Records in England at the age of 14. Later he moved to Trident Studios, where he worked with people such as Gus Dudgeon and Tony Visconti.
The Smashing Pumpkins are currently in the recording studio with Baker at work on their first new album since 2000.[1]
